SATIRE VI.

This is nol only the longest, but the most complete of our au-
thor’s works. With respect to his other Satires, some of them ’
are distinguished by one excellence, and some by aaudiat, but
in'this he has combined them all. Forcible in argument, flowing
m diction, bold, impassioned, and sublime ; it seems as if the poet

had risen with his theme, and, conscious of its extent, taxed ell ’

his powers to do it justice.

The whole of this Satire is abitter invective against the semele
sex, and the poet endeavors to dissuade his friend Ursidius Pos-
tumus from marriage, at the expense of the whole sex.

lt would seem, from intemal evidence, that this Satira was
written under Domitian. It has few political allusione, and
might not, from its subject, perhaps, have been displeasing to that
ferocibus hypocrite, who affected, at various timeS, a wonderful
anxiety to restrain the licentiousness of the age.
