'l'his Satira rs addressed to Telesmua, a poet, and contains aa
animated account of the general discouragement, under which
literature labored at Rome.

Beginning with Poetry, it proceeds with great regularity
through the various departments oinstory, law, Oratory, Rhot-
0ric,and Grammar3 having many curiousanecdotes interspersad,
and each different head enlivened with such seducat, humorous,
and sentimental remarks, as naturally flow from the subject.

1. Spes: the hope of reward for the labor of the learned.-
Ratio: the reason why men apply themselves-Casuras itis
probable, thot either the emperor Hadrian, or Trajan, is meant.-
Many think it is Domitian.

2. Dictus: ‘neglected’

3. Respexit: ‘has looked with eyes of favor!

4. emunim.- to hire, in order to make a livelihood thereby;
or it may si nify (as we find it used in Cicero, ΙΙ. de Dinia) ta
undertake e work or management of.

6. Aganippes: a fountain in a solitnry part of Boeotia consc-
crated to the Muses.

9. Mancre.- Macboeru was probably the name of some noted
crrer.

10. Commissa . . . auctio: an auctionis said to be commissu,
when erdrusted to the honesty and activity of the auctionem.-
Some think it alluded to the comanissiou of the magistrates, who
sanctioned the sale. And others, that it ia used figuratively sor
the strife of the purchasers‚ who may be said, like gladiatore,
inter se corniculi—A sale of this kind is called auctio (from uu·
geo, to increase), because the bidders raiae the price against each
other. ,

11. Staratibua: ‘to the bidders standing round.'—Pucct . ..
Foruli: Paccius and Faustus seem bo be the names of two
wretched tragic writers.

14. Equites Aaiaaai: the poet satirizes those noblemen, who
curioh their Asiatic slaves, and hod them enrolled among the
knights. These Asiatica were notorious perjurers.

15. Cappadoces.- the Cappadociam were, like the Cretans,
liars ond dishonest to a proverb ; yet many of them found favor,
and obtained wealth at Rome.

16. Altera . .. Gallia.- Gallo-Gracia or Galatia—Nudo
talo: ‘with naked feet,' like poor persons or slaves exposed fir
sale.

18. Nectit.. modis: the perfectiori of heroic poetry, wilri·
seems here to be intended, is the uniting grand aud lofly aa·
prosaica, eloquium uocate, with tunesad mensures, modis canoris.

19. Laurumque naonmrclit: the eating of the laurel was sup·

posed to inspire young poets with noble ideas.
