SATIRE ΙΙΙ.

Umbricius, an Aruspex‚ and afriend of Juvenal, disgusted ot
the prevalence of vice, and totsl disregard of unassumin virtue,
is introduced on the point of quitting Rome forCumre. he poet
accompanies him some little way from the city, when the honest
exile, no longer ableto suppress his indignum, acquaints him
with the causes of his retirement.

What he says may be manged under the following beside,-
that Flattery and Vice are the only thriving arts at Rome 3 that
in these, particularly the first, foreigners heve a manifest superi-
ority over the natives, and consequeutly engross all favor3 that
the poor are universally exposed tc scorn and insult3 that the
general habits of extravagnncc render it difficult for them to rub·
sist3 and that a crowded capital subjecte them to numberless in·
conveniences unknown in the countryr he then again adverte tc
the peculim sufferings of the poorer citizens from the want of a
well regulated police; dress he illustrares by a variety of exam·
ples, and concludes in a strain of pathos and beauty, which winde
up the whole with singular effect.
